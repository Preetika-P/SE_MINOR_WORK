### Task A1: Call by Value in C

In **Task A1**, we explore the concept of **Call by Value** in the C programming language. This method of passing function parameters means that a copy of the variable is sent to the function, not the actual variable itself. As a result, any changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable outside the function.

### Task A2: Usability Study Report on Two UIs

For **Task A2**, we analyzed the usability of two well-known software products: **Microsoft Word** and **Google Docs**.

**Usability** refers to how easy and pleasant it is to use a software product. Here's what stands out for each of them:

**Product 1: Microsoft Word**  
- The interface is user-friendly, and the tools are easy to find thanks to the ribbon menu.
- There are plenty of tutorials and help articles available, which makes troubleshooting easier.

**Product 2: Google Docs**  
- Google Docs excels at **real-time collaboration**, allowing multiple users to edit documents simultaneously and see changes as they happen.
- It is accessible from any device with an internet connection, so you can use it on your phone, tablet, or laptop, and your documents are always available.

### Task A3: Features of Programming Languages

In **Task A3**, we focused on several key features that make programming languages more robust and user-friendly:

1. **Error Handling**: The code checks for errors, like division by zero, so the program doesn't crash but instead shows a helpful error message.
2. **Strong Typing**: By specifying data types like `int`, Java reduces mistakes that can happen when different data types are mixed. This makes the code safer and clearer.
3. **Modularity**: The code is split into small, focused methods like `divide` and `createArray`, making it easier to read, maintain, and modify.
4. **Array Management**: The `createArray` method shows how to make an array, which can easily be adjusted if we need different sizes.
5. **Input Validation**: Although we didn't include detailed input checks here, the code is structured so that it’s easy to add input validation later.
6. **Clear Output**: The code provides meaningful messages explaining what’s happening, making the output easier to understand.
7. **Resource Management**: By managing arrays properly, the program runs efficiently and avoids wasting memory.
8. **Simplicity**: The overall design is simple, reducing the chances of bugs and making it easier for others to follow and understand.
